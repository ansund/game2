# Game Development Plan

1. Add boundaries and camera movement:

   - Implement a larger game world that extends beyond the visible canvas.
   - Make the camera follow the player as they move.

2. Introduce AI opponents:

   - Create simple AI-controlled blobs that move around and eat food.
   - Implement basic chase/avoid behavior for AI blobs.

3. Player vs Player interactions:

   - Allow larger blobs to eat smaller ones (both AI and player-controlled).
   - Implement a splitting mechanism (like in agar.io) to add strategy.

4. Power-ups and special abilities:

   - Add temporary speed boosts, size increases, or special effects.
   - Implement a cooldown system for these abilities.

5. Scoring system and leaderboard:

   - Track player score based on size and/or food eaten.
   - Display a live leaderboard of top players.

6. Visual improvements:

   - Add simple animations for eating and growing.
   - Implement a zoom feature based on player size.
   - Add background elements or a grid for better depth perception.

7. Sound effects and background music:

   - Add sound effects for eating, growing, and collisions.
   - Include background music to enhance the gaming experience.

8. Game modes:

   - Implement different game modes like time attack or survival.
   - Add a simple menu system to choose between modes.

9. Multiplayer functionality:

   - Implement basic networking for real-time multiplayer.
   - Allow players to join the same game world.

10. Performance optimizations:
    - Implement spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection.
    - Optimize rendering for a large number of entities.
